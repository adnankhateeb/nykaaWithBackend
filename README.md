A clone of the website nykaa.com. Built front end using HTML CSS JS & backend using Node, MongoDB and Express.

The backend involved various validations. If the user logging in is an admin, they will be redirected to a separate admin dashboard from where they can update and add new products. If the user logging in is a seller, they can modify the products that were added by them but can't modify the products added by other sellers. If the user is neither a seller nor an admin, they'll be redirected to the homepage where they can access the site normally.
